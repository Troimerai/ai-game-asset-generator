- SQLite (Database)
- Pydantic (Data validation)
- PIL/Pillow (Image processing)
- Uvicorn (ASGI server)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Asset Generation
- **POST** `/api/v1/generate-asset`
  - Generate AI-powered game assets from text prompts
  - Supports: textures, sprites, icons, backgrounds
  - Multiple style options: realistic, cartoon, pixel, minimalist

### Debugging Assistance
- **POST** `/api/v1/debug`
  - Analyze game development errors
  - Provides suggested solutions and documentation links
  - Supports Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot

### Asset Management
- **GET** `/api/v1/assets`
  - Retrieve history of generated assets
  - Includes metadata and generation statistics

### Health Check
- **GET** `/health`
  - System health and status information

## Example Usage

### Generate a Texture
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/generate-asset", json={
    "prompt": "medieval stone wall texture",
    "asset_type": "texture",
    "style": "realistic",
    "dimensions": "512x512"
})

result = response.json()
print(f"Generated asset: {result['asset_id']}")
```

### Debug Assistance
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/debug", json={
    "error_message": "NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object",
    "engine_type": "unity"
})

debug_info = response.json()
print(f"Solutions: {debug_info['suggested_solutions']}")
```
